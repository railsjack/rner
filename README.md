# RNer (React Native App Maker)  

This is a sub-framework of React-Naitve, and it provides a way to create screens and components for the mobile application.  

## Installation
### Yarn
```
yarn global add rner
```

### NPM
```
npm install -g rner
```

### Creating a project
ex: App name is Demo
```
rner new Demo
```



### Philosophy
In terms of structural views of React-Native app, there are many ways to create a screen or component in React-Native development.  
In some projects, it is called as a "Componet" and in some case it is called as "Screen".  
Some developers call it as "Page".  
But, here I believe that "Screen" is the most appropriate name for the mobile application.  


### Note:  
In the case of MVC, the view is generated by a controller on which the user's request arrived.
That is, the view of MVC, can happen to appear only when the controller is calleed, and the controller can be showen only when the user's request happen to call (or a case when CLI comand is called).  
In the React Native mobile application, however, there are many differences in order to use the MVC model.  
So, I will not mention about MVC here any more.  
Instead, we might use MVVM model in our application in future.
